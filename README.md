# ImagingEcosystem
The Imaging Ecosystem (well, parts of it, anyway).
The Imaging Ecosystem encompasses tools used to capture, transfer, store, and process confocal microscopy images. Some of the components are in their own repos:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/FL-web">Fly Light external websites</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/janelia-workstation">Janelia Workstation</a></li>
</ul>
